# novena-logo
Official logo of the Novena open hardware computer.

    20:59 < ex-parrot> xobs: is there any particular license the logo should be considered as being under?
    21:02 <@xobs> ex-parrot: We hadn't decided on one, but I'd say the same license as the PCB files.
    21:02 < ex-parrot> works for me
